# font-size-controller
Simple JS to allow incrementally increasing/decreasing font sizes of writing on a page (in my use case, for a single p tag called "chapter" in which I place the entirety of each chapter). I wanted to code something from scratch that would allow toggling in either direction between all default named values of the CSS/JSS font-size/fontSize property. Fully HTML-integrated (as in, script included in its entirety in script tag in the head element, with a page that displays its functionality) example at example.html, but code is provided as a standalone .js file as well.
